Our game utilizes a fuel system that allows the car to move forward. 
This system requires players to hit certain obstacles (zombies) to gain cash which then gets converted into fuel in order to keep moving. 

We used a texture atlas to give the car a neat visual effect - shiny windows. We've also used a mixed audio for background music of two OSTs (My Friend Pedro and DOOM).
